            <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
            <p>Off-campus student housing is a popular option for people who don’t want to live in dorms due to price, privacy, lack of amenities, and other issues.
                Lease terms are often inflexible, and require a one year commitment. This proves to be a problem for most college students because many of them plan
                to go home or travel over summer, or have their plans disrupted by unforseen events. For example, COVID-19 has impacted many student housing plans in
                the past year, as international students were prohibited from travelling back to the states and many students went home to quarantine with family. In
                the end, many students ended up cancelling leases, losing deposits, or paying for housing they weren't even living in. The amount of money lost could
                be devastating. While there exists a market for those looking to sublease homes/apartments, it's often difficult to find prices within your budget and places
                that fit your needs. These problems stem from lack of information - having no central source to find listings (as they are often scattered in obscure
                platforms, and existing listings lacking details which make them seem untrustworthy. </p>
            <p>Some existing solutions to this problem include asking friends, posting to Facebook groups, listing places in Facebook marketplace, Sublet.com, 
                or email subscriptions to housing near UW. However, there is not a go-to platform for students that would provide abundant information and ensure
                security and timeliness. These solutions also do not allow people to filter their options efficiently, and many posts lack important details, which
                makes apartment hunting even harder. </p>

            <h2>App Description</h2>
            <p>The users of this application will be students looking to sublease their apartment and students looking for temporary housing. We decided not to
                expand our user base to just “anyone” looking for subleases due to security and comfort issues. The only people who can access this website will
                be students who can log in with SSO through school provided emails to ensure security. his app would contain 2 main functions, posting listings
                & finding potential subleasing options. This will not include data from an external source because each student will be uploading their own
                information, but they will be allowed the option to link their apartment website for authentication. Specific interactions we want to explore include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Viewing listings</li>
                <li>Filtering listings by price, square footage, private room, private bath, number of housemates, available dates etc.</li>
                <li>Adding a listing</li>
                <li>Viewing listing locations on a map</li>
                <li>Adding housemates to a listing</li>
                <li>Sending messages to other users</li>
                <li>Submitting an interest form</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This app will solve our problem because it will make searching for housing or someone to take over your housing lease much easier and
                much more secure. It will help users keep in touch until the sublease ends and save information about price agreements, insurance, and photos for 
                potential damage disagreements. Another potential solution to ensuring that there are no complications with the sublease is allowing the
                the landlord to authenticate/verify listings and help screen subtenants. Our goal is to help students find subleases that suits their needs 
                without the risk of a scam or danger. It will also make students more comfortable if they know all the details, including who their new housemates
                are.
