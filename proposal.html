        <h1>Project Proposal</h1>

        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        <p>Off-campus student housing is a popular option for people who don’t want to live in dorms due to price, privacy, lack of amenities, and other issues. A lot of students are struggling to find apartments because the leases are usually not flexible, and they have to submit an application to each apartment so this process would cost them a lot of time and energy. These are also some of the reasons why some students prefer to find subleasing. With uncertain situations like COVID affecting those who must leave their apartments, paying for housing you don’t live in can be devastating. Even though there is a market for subleasing, whenever students have to leave for a period of time, they often struggle to find people to sublease to. </p>
        <p>Some existing solutions to this problem include asking friends, posting to Facebook groups, listing places in Facebook marketplace, Sublet.com, or email subscriptions to housing near UW. However, there is not a go-to platform for students that would provide abundant information and ensure security and timeliness. These solutions also do not allow people to filter their options efficiently, and many posts lack important details, which makes apartment hunting even harder. </p>
